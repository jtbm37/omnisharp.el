This is a fork of the official [[https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-emacs][omnisharp mode]]. This has been created due to lack of interest from original author.

This will only work with [[https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/][omnisharp-roslyn]] server.

** Prerequisites

   Omnisharp-roslyn must be installed and present in your PATH.

   The following emacs packages are needed: dash.el, flycheck, company, TBD...

** Installation
   As this is a fork, it cannot be on melpa.

   1) Clone the repo

   2) Generate the autoloads

   3) Load them in your init.file

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   
  (add-to-load-path (expand-file-name "~/path/to/omnisharp.el"))
  (load "omnisharp-autoloads.el")
   
   #+END_SRC


** Configuration

*** Spacemacs
    I use this [[https://gist.github.com/jtbm37/f8aacc57192b65b5387ba9a159b3b47b][custom layer]]. Put it in your layer folder and add it to =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers=.

*** Fuzzy completion
    By default, completion is quite simple and doesn't allow you to fuzzy complete. 
    Set these variables in your init file to get fuzzy completion.
    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
      (setq omnisharp-company-match-type 'company-match-flx
            omnisharp-company-match-sort-by-flx-score t)
    #+END_SRC
